<h2>Information for Visiting Scott</h2>
<h3>Weekdays 8AM-4PM</h3>
<p>During the weekdays, Scott has a busy schedule of PT (Physical Therapy), OT (Occupational Therapy), Speech Therapy, and other sessions to help him through the recovery process.  This schedule changes from day to day, and the day's schedule is typically not known until the night before.  Having visitors during this timeframe is not essential, but it would be nice to have up to 1 person during these times.  If he has a therapy session during your visit, you most likely will be able to sit in the room and observe Scott's progress as he works through the session.  If he's free, you are welcome to just hangout with him or perhaps help wheel him around the hospital, maybe visit the coffee shops downstairs or go to the cafeteria, play card games, or whatever you and Scott want to do.  He should be back to his room 10 minutes before his next session.</p>
<h3>Weekdays after 4PM</h3>
<p>Therapy sessions should be done by around 4.  He is free in the evenings to hangout or do things around the hospital, but be aware that he may be worn out by this time.  The sessions can take a sizeable amount of energy and he may be exhausted by evening.  We should limit the number of visitors to a maximum of about 4 at any time.</p>
<h3>Weekends</h3>
<p>As time elapses, we will find out more of what is allowed.  Scott will eventually be able to leave the hospital for a visit or two over the weekend.  He can have more visitors during weekends, but not necessarily a crowd.  Again, any more than 4 or so visitors may be too many.</p>
